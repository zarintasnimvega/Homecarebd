A Website for Connecting Nursing Attendants with Patients in Need of Home Care.This website will be a bridge between people seeking care and people offering their services. So, our website provides both convenience and job opportunities. While similar websites/companies exist, they usually assign nurses randomly to patients without giving either party the option to choose. Our website will be different as:
● Patients/employers can review available nurses and select one based on their
specific needs (among the list of nurses who applied for their posted job).
● Nurses/attendants can choose jobs based on their preferences, such as
specializing in cancer patient care, paralysis assistance, or general elderly care
etc.
Additionally, this platform will create job opportunities for part-time nurses who work in clinics and for individuals seeking entry-level healthcare jobs.
